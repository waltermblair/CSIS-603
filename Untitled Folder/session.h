/// \brief A Session instance lets a caller drive a TensorFlow graph
/// computation.
///
/// When a Session is created with a given target, a new Session object
/// is bound to the universe of resources specified by that target.
/// Those resources are available to this session to perform
/// computation described in the GraphDef.  After extending the session
/// with a graph, the caller uses the Run() API to perform the
/// computation and potentially fetch outputs as Tensors.
///
/// Example:
///
/// ```c++
///
///     tensorflow::GraphDef graph;
///     // ... Create or load graph into "graph".
///
///     // This example uses the default options which connects
///     // to a local runtime.
///     tensorflow::SessionOptions options;
///     std::unique_ptr<tensorflow::Session>
///     session(tensorflow::NewSession(options));
///
///     // Create the session with this graph.
///     tensorflow::Status s = session->Create(graph);
///     if (!s.ok()) { ... }
///
///     // Run the graph and fetch the first output of the "output"
///     // operation, and also run to but do not return anything
///     // for the "update_state" operation.
///     std::vector<tensorflow::Tensor> outputs;
///     s = session->Run({}, {"output:0"}, {"update_state"}, &outputs);
///     if (!s.ok()) { ... }
///
///     // Map the output as a flattened float tensor, and do something
///     // with it.
///     auto output_tensor = outputs[0].flat<float>();
///     if (output_tensor(0) > 0.5) { ... }
///
///     // Close the session to release the resources associated with
///     // this session.
///     session->Close();
///
/// ```
///
/// A Session allows concurrent calls to Run(), though a Session must
/// be created / extended by a single thread.
///
/// Only one thread must call Close(), and Close() must only be called
/// after all other calls to Run() have returned.

/// (started prior to the Reset()) may continue to make to resources, provided
/// all those resources are in containers listed in "containers".

/// Old sessions may continue to have side-effects on resources not in
/// containers listed in "containers", and thus may affect future
/// sessions' results in ways that are hard to predict.  Thus, if well-defined
/// behavior is desired, it is recommended that all containers be listed in
/// "containers".

/// names. When a resource container is reset, the resources held by the

/// will become undefined.  If the "containers" vector is empty, the default
/// container is assumed.  If the "containers" vector is non-empty, the
